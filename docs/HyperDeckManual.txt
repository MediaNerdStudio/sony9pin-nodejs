Using an External RS-422 Controller 
All current HyperDeck models feature an industry standard Sony� compatible RS-422 deck control port, which has the correct pin connections for a direct connection to any remote controller with RS-422. 
You can use pre-manufactured 9 pin cables as long as each end of the cable is wired �pin for pin� where the same pin numbers on each end of the cable are connected together. If you would like to make custom cables, please refer to the accompanying wiring diagram. 
You can remotely control your HyperDeck from an RS-422 controller instead of locally pushing buttons. 
1 Connect a video signal to your HyperDeck�s video input. 
2 Connect an RS-422 cable from your external controller to your HyperDeck. 
3 Enable remote control by pressing the remote button on the front control panel, or via the LCD menu in HyperDeck Studio Mini, to allow remote deck control. 
You can now remotely start and stop recording and playback of your HyperDeck as well as performing other common jog and shuttle functions. The full list of supported RS-422 commands is in the following section named �supported RS-422 commands�.

Transferring Files over a Network 
With Blackmagic HyperDeck Studio Mini, you can access files on your disk recorder over a network using file transfer protocol, or �ftp�. This means that you don�t have to remove SD cards from your HyperDeck Studio Mini to transfer files to and from the recorder. 
Connecting to HyperDeck Studio Mini 
With your computer and HyperDeck Studio Mini on the same network, all you�ll need is an ftp�client and your HyperDeck Studio Mini�s IP address. 
1 Download and install an FTP client on the computer you want to connect your HyperDeck to. We�recommend Cyberduck, FileZilla or Transmit but most FTP�applications will work. Cyberduck and FileZilla are free downloads. 
2 Connect your HyperDeck Studio Mini to your network using an Ethernet cable and note�its IP address. To access the IP address, press the �menu� button and rotate the �jog/shuttle� wheel to access the �network� screen. You�ll see your HyperDeck Studio Mini�s IP address at the bottom of this screen.
