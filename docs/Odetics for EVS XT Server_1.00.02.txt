Clip ID 
 
The EVS server is able work in two different modes with the clip ID’s.  
The first mode is related with a “server” using ID of 8 bytes characters with no restrictions. That is what we called ‘ID Louth’ type of ID. 
 
The second mode is closely related with the LSM. The clip ID for the LSM mode, we call ‘IDLSM’, has 8 bytes with the following conventions:  
 
- Page (1 byte): [0..9] 

- Bank(1 byte): [1..9] 

- Clip number in the bank (1 byte): [0..9] 

- Camera ID (1 byte): A, B, C, D, E or F (upper case !) 

- The machine number (2 bytes): [1..29] defined in the EVS software under “Network” and in the field “Net Number”. 

- Last byte is a blank.  


For instance 114A/00 is a valid ID. It is located on the local machine. The clip 120C/12 is also valid and is located on the remote machine numbered 12.  
 
In the IDLSM mode, the functions to get the database also upload to the controller all the cameras (that we also call ‘train’). These ‘special’ clips can not be used in playlist (‘auto mode’) and some functions have a special behaviour when used with cameras (i.e. mainly the CueUpWithData function). Example: the LSMID for the CamA on machine number 17 is: 0 0 0 “A” 17 “blank” 
 
In the IDLouth mode,  the cameras can not be not uploaded. Only clips can be viewed from a controller, although a live can be view on a channel by the use of the Record or Eject command. 
 
IDLouth or IDLSM mode has to be selected into the XT’s VGA menu (shift-F2) in the “RS422 Protocols / ID Type” field. 
 
Commands that have been extended for EVS server 
 
Some commands are not implemented like it is specified in the Odetics protocol. This chapter explained how these commands are implemented and extended for the EVS server.  
 
As the EVS server can not manage editing on an existing clip ID, the command RecordCueUpWithData is a subset of the corresponding command defined in the Odetics protocol documentation: “Video Disk Recorder: Command and Control Specification” rev.F (6/16/98). 
2 CueUpWithData  



This command is working differently if used with IDLSM or IDLouth. 
The main is difference is when the function is used with a train. 
 
20.31  
If the current clip is a train then goto Live on this train.  
If the current clip is not a train then cueup on the clip IN point. 
 
24.31 
 This is the CueUp as implemented with the Sony protocol. 
 
28.31  
If the given clip is a train, then load at out – 2 (also works on a remote train).  
If the given clip is not a train then load and cueup on the clip point IN.  
If ID is a train that has never been started (IN point equal to OUT point) than does nothing. 
 
2C.31  
Load the given clip ID and cueUp on the given time code. If the given time code doesn’t exist and ID is a train then cueup  on the train out point(it is useful for controller using only TC=00:00:00:00 like the TDC100).  
If ID is a clip and TC=00:00:00:00 then cueUp on the clip IN point.  
If ID is a clip and TC doesn’t exist in the clip then does nothing. 
 
3 RecordCueUpWithData  



A0.02  
RecordCueUpWithData with no ID and no time code. Since the EVS server doesn’t support clip editing, a new clip ID is created with an automatic ID. For IDLouth, the new clip ID will have the format CXXXXXXX where XXXXXXX is a number generated inside the server. The time code corresponding to the IN point of the newly created clip will be 00:00:00:00. 
 
A4.02  
This function is identical to the function A0.02 excepted for the time code corresponding to the IN point of the newly created clip will be the one given in the command. 
 
A8.02 and AC.02  
They have the same behaviour as explained in the Odetics protocol documentation excepted if the given ID already exists. In this case, the command is simply refused. 
 
This function reset the out preset value. The function uses the couple Preroll/CueUp (see CueUpWithData) to indicate the command status. If, after the command, these two bits are not set then an error occurred. 
4 Record  



This function is working differently if a RecordCueUpWithData has been sent or not. 
- if RecordCueUpWithData has been sent, then it is the record command as defined for the Odetics protocol. 

- If RecordCueUpWithData has not been sent before then there is two cases: 

o If no clip has been previously preloaded or the current clip is not a train then the default train is loaded on live. 

o If the current clip is already a train then it goes on live.  




It is possible to play a clip while it is recording on another player channel. 
 
5 EVS Additional commands 

5.1 GetEvent (B0.00)  



Each Odetics communication port maintains a queue of events. 
The return of this function depends of the event that has occurred into the system. 
 
Format : B0.00 
Return :  9X.00.XX. 
XX is the event type (not present when there is no event in the queue, i.e. when 90.00)

This function is not fixed and new events can be added in the future. 
5.2 SetIdForData/SetData (BX.02)  



A 12 characters data can be associated with a clip ID. This function selects the target ID that will be used with the command SetData. SetData contains the data that will be store with the previously defined clip ID. These functions have been split to keep the Sony protocol format for the commands.  
 
Ex: 
First, we send the target clip ID that will receive a new 12 characters data: 
B8 02 43 6C 69 70 30 30 31 37 cs = 0a (The ID is Clip0017) 
Then we sent the data (the data is ABCDEFGHIJKL): 
BC 02 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 4A 4B 4C cs = 0c 
5.3 List Clip Protect TC (B8.06)  



This function is the same as the A8.17 (List clip TC) but it returns the Protects IN/OUT instead of the short In/ short Out points. The difference is the “GuardBands” included with the Protects. 
5.4 GetData (B8.03)  



Return the data (.i.e the name as called in the XT Server) associated with the clip ID specified in the command. 
Ex: To get the data associated with the clip Clip0017, the command will be: 
B8 03 43 6C 69 70 30 30 31 37 cs = 0b 
The return will be: 
9C.03 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX 
 
5.5 MakeClip (BX.04) 


There is two groups of functions to create a clip.  
First group is related to ID LSM: 
- B4.04: only use a format like 111A 

- B6.04: like the previous function but with a guardband. 

- B7.04: use a full LSM ID like 113B/00 for the local machine or 114C/23 for a networked machine. 

- B9.04: use a full LSM ID and a guardband.  



Second group is related to ID Louth: 
- B8.04 only use a clip ID Louth. 

- BA.04 use an ID Louth and a guardband.  



The guardband is always transmitted on two bytes. 
 
Ex: 
First use the functions 40.10 and 40.11 to define the time code IN and time code OUT of the new clip. Then use the MakeClip to create the clip 111A/00 with a guardband of 0: 
B9 04 31 31 31 41 2F 30 30 00 00   cs = 20 
Here is an example with an ID Louth=Clip0101 and a guardband of 5 frames: 
BA 04 43 6C 69 70 30 31 30 31 05 00 cs = 0d 
 
5.6 SetIDEVSStatus (BA.05)  
 



This function set EVS specifics status on a given clip. The format is: 
 
ID: 8 bytes. The target clip ID. 
 
Bitmap: 1 byte.  Defines the content of the command. Presently only bit 0x01 is used to specify Xfile status. 
 
Status: 1 byte. The new status: 
- Bit 0x01:”toStore” => the clip will be stored in the Xfile. 

- Bit 0x02:”stored” => the clip is stored in the Xfile.  
 



To get the Xfile status, the function A8.18 has been extended. The bit 0x10 is the “toStore” status and the bit 0x20 is the “stored” status. 
 
Example: To Set the Xfile flag “ToStore” on the clip “Clip0017”: 
 
BA 05  43 6C 69 70 30 30 31 37 01 01 cs = 11 
 
The last byte is 01 to set the "ToStore" and reset the "Stored". 
To Set the "Stored" flag and reset the ToStore", use 02 
To reset both flags, use 00. 
 
To get these flags on a given clip, use the standard A8.18 ID Status Request 
Odetics command. 
The returns is 81.18. The returned byte (let say "rc") contains: 
- rc & 0x10 is the "ToStore" XFile flag. 
- rc & 0x20 is the "Stored" XFile flag 
- rc & 0x01means "Does this clip exist on the system" 
- rc & 0x02 means "Does this clip is loaded on the channel" 
 
5.7 GetKeyword (B9.07)  



Gets a keyword associated with a clip. A clip can have three keywords. A keyword is a 12 characters long data. The format is: 
 
Format : B9.07 + Clip ID (8 bytes) + keyword selector (1 byte) 
The keyword selector is in the range [1..3] to select the target keyword. 
Return :  9D.07 + keyword (12 bytes) + keyword selector (1 byte). 
 
If the clip ID doesn’t exist, the return is 90.07. 
 
5.8 SetKeyword (BX.08)  



This function is split into two parts: 
 
Format : 
B8.08 + clip ID 
This function is used to store a clip ID for a future used for the keyword setting. 
BD.08 + keyword (12 bytes) + keyword selector (1 byte) 
This function is used to store keyword with the clip ID previously defined with the B8.08 function. The keyword selector defines the target selector ([range is [1..3]). 
 
Events (see GetEvent here above) : 
0x0C : clip id not found 
 
The target clip ID is not reset after this function. It is then possible to use the BD.08 function three times with the appropriate keyword selector to define the three keywords associated with a clip. 
5.9 General information function (BX.09)  



This new function is used to get information specifics to the XT server. The third byte is used as a selector for the information requested. 
 
Format : 
BX 09 YY Data, where 
BX 09 is the function, X depending on the selector. 
YY is the function selector. 
Data is the data depending on the function selector. 
 
5.9.1 Current ID Loaded on the channel (ActiveIDRequest).  



Returns the clip ID currently loaded on the channel. This function can be useful if the clip has been loaded by an external source (another protocol that also has the control on this channel for instance). 
 
Format: 
 B1.09.01 
Return: 
 0x99.09.01 + ID (Louth or LSM) of the clip loaded. 
 0x91.09.01 if no clip loaded on the channel. 
5.9.2 Conversion IDLSMID Louth.  



Format: 
B9.09.04 + ID LSM(8 bytes) Convert the given ID LSM to its corresponding ID Louth.  
B9.09.05 + ID Louth(8 bytes) Convert the given ID Louth to its corresponding ID LSM.  
 
Return : 
The return is 99.09.04 + ID Louth(8 bytes) or 91.09.04 if the given ID LSM has not been found. 
The return is 99.09.05 + ID LSM(8 bytes) or 91.09.05 if the given ID Louth has not been found. 
 
 
5.10 NetMoveClipIdVDCP (B9.0A)  



Move a clip to target machine. 
The source clip is identified by a VDCP id. 
 
Format: B9.OA + VDCP clip id (8 bytes) + machine target id (1 byte) 
 
Events (see GetEvent here above) : 
0x0A : XFile does not support this move clip 
0x0B : target machine not found 
0x0C : clip id not found 
0x0D : clip id is protected 
0x0E : No more free space on the target machine 
0x0F : SDTI network error 
5.11 NetMoveClipIdLsm (B9.0B)  



Move a clip to target machine. 
The source clip is identified by a Lsm id. 
The target machine is identified by the target Lsm id 
 
Format : B9 0B ‘X’ + LSM id (8 bytes), where ‘X’ is the function selector : 
X = ‘S’ (53) => set the source clip id 
X = ‘T’ (54) => set the target clip id and do the move 
 
Events (see GetEvent here above) : 
0x09 : clip id is already used 
0x0A : XFile that does not support this move clip 
0x0B : target machine not found 
0x0C : clip id not found 
0x0D : clip id is protected 
0x0F : SDTI network error 
 
This function is split into two parts : 
 
First, set the source clip ID : 
B9 0B 53 + Lsm source id (8 bytes) 
Then do the move 
B9 0B 54 + Lsm target id (8 bytes)  
 
5.12 NetCopyClipIdVDCP (BX.0C)  



Copy a clip to target machine. 
The source and target clips are identified by a VDCP id. 
 
This function is split into two parts : 
 
Format : 
B8 0C  + source VDCP ID (8 bytes) 
First, set the source clip ID : 
B9 0C  + ID target machine (1 byte) + target VDCP ID (8 bytes)  
Then do the copy 
 
Events (see GetEvent here above) : 
0x09 : clip id is already used 
0x0A : XFile that does not support this copy clip 
0x0B : target machine not found 
0x0C : clip id not found 
0x0F : SDTI network error 
 
5.13 NetCopyClipIdLsm (B9.0D)  



Copy a clip to target machine. 
The source and target clips are identified by a Lsm id. 
The target machine is identified by the target Lsm id 
 
Format : B9 0D ‘X’ + ID LSM (8 bytes), where ‘X’ is the function selector : 
X = ‘S’ (53) => set the source clip ID 
X = ‘T’ (54) => set the target clip ID and do the copy 
 
Events (see GetEvent here above) : 
0x09 : clip id is already used 
0x0A : XFile that does not support this copy clip 
0x0B : target machine not found 
0x0C : clip id not found 
0x0F : SDTI network error 
 
This function is split into two parts : 
 
First, set the source clip ID : 
B9 0D 53 + Lsm source id (8 bytes) 
Then do the move 
B9 0D 54 + Lsm target id (8 bytes)  
 
5.14 GetFirstMachine (B0.0E)  



Get the list of machines in the SDTI network. 
Use this function to get the first machine in the SDTI network. 
 
Format : B0.0E 
To get the first machine. 
 
Return : 
If the return is 90.0E => there is no machine running in the SDTI network. 
Else, the return is as following : 
9A.0E + machine name (8 first bytes) + machine id (1 byte) + bits field (1 byte) 
The bits field is as following : 
 
7 
 6 
 5 
 4 
 3 
 2 
 1 
 0 
 
Reserved 
 machine type 
 clip edit 
by network 
 


 
 
Bits 1-3 = machine type => 8 types possible 
For now, only 4 types are used : 
0 = Unknown 
1 = LSM 
2 = XFile 
3 = Max 
4-7 = Reserved 
 
Example for this bits field : 
Bits field = 0x03 means the machine is a LSM and the Clip edit by network is set to “Yes” 
Bits field = 0x06 means the machine is a Max and the Clip edit by network is set to “No” 
 
5.15 GetNextMachine (B0.0F)  



Get the list of machines in the SDTI network. 
Use this function after a first call to previous function GetFirstMachine (B0.0E). 
 
Format : B0.0F 
To get the next machine. 
 
Return : 
As long as the return is not 90.0E, call this function to get all the machines running in the SDTI network. 
The return is as following : 
9A.OF + machine name (8 first bytes) + machine id (1 byte) + bits field (1 byte) 
The bits field is described here above in the previous function GetFirstMachine (B0.0E). 
 
5.16 SetOptions (B4.10)  



Format : B4.10 + options (4 bytes) 
 
options is a bits field (32 bits), used as following : 
 
31 … 1 
 0 
 
Reserved 
 Use guard bands 
 


 
For now, only bit 0 is used : 
If it is set, it is allowed to use guard bands, i.e. outside the range short in   short out 
5.17 GetOptions (B0.11)  



Format : B0.11 
 
Return :  94.11 + options (4 bytes) 
 
See options described here above in the previous function SetOptions (B4.10). 
 
5.18 SetInOut (BX.12)  



Update clip short in & short out 
First use the functions 40.10 and 40.11 to define the time code Short IN and time code Short OUT of the clip to be updated, identified by the given clip id. 
 
Format : 
B4.12 + ID LSM format like 111A for the local machine (4 bytes) 
B7.12 + ID LSM format like 113B/00 for the local machine or 114C/23 for a networked machine (7 bytes) 
B8.12 + ID Louth (8 bytes) 
 
Events (see GetEvent here above) : 
0x0C : clip id not found 
 
5.19 Live (B8.13)  



This command goes to live on the current channel with the camera specified as argument (8 bytes for the camera id). The id can be specified as an ID LSM or an ID Louth. It can also be a remote camera (i.e. not local).
