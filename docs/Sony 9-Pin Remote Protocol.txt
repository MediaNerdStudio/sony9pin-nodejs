Sony 9-Pin Remote Protocol
This is not the offical Sony 9-pin protocol. It is a summary for reference puroposes only. To obtain theprotocol document, contact Sony directly.Updated 6/16/96. Fixed the Prog Speed formula. Added Tables. Added all group 20 descriptions, more infoon status bits, and most of the group 40 commands.
Communication Format
The protocol is based on the EIA RS-422-A signal standard, usually at 38.4 kBit/s. The data are sent as 1 startbit + 8 data bits + 1 parity bit + 1 stop bit. Parity is odd: the bitwise sum of data bits 0 -7 and the parity bit isan odd number.Command Block Format
The controlling device and the controlled device communicate through the interchange of command blocks.The bytes in each command block are assigned as follows:CMD-1/DATA COUNT. CMD-1 is the upper 4 bits, DATA COUNT is the lower 4.
CMD-2.
DATA-1 up to DATA-N, where n is the value in data count
CHECKSUM

CMD-1Indicates the function and direction of the command, according to:0 System control (Master->Slave) 
1 Return for 0,2, or 4 of cmd-1 (Slave->Master) 
2 Transport Control (Master->Slave) 
4 Preset/Select control (Master->Slave) 
6 Sense Request (Master->Slave) 
7 Sense Return (Slave->Master) 

DATA COUNTIndicates the number of bytes ( max 15 ) inserted between CMD-2 and CHECKSUMCMD-2Designates the command. Refer to the command table for definitions. Ex. CMD-1=0 and CMD-2=0Cmeans LOCAL DISABLE.DATA-1 to DATA-NData which correspond to those indicated by the command. Refer to the command table for dataformats.CHECKSUMLower eight bits of the sum of the bytes in the command block.Communication Protocol
The protocol is initiated by the master. The slave should return a response within 9 msec. The response maybe:NAK + Error Data: Undefined command or communication error
COMMAND + Data: if Command requested data
ACK: if Command did not request data

The master should not send another command until receiving a response from the slave device. The mastermust also insure that no more than 10 msec lapses between bytes in a command block. The master mustimmediatly stop sending data when it receives a NAK + Error Data message. If the Error Data contains"Undefined Command" the master may immediatley send another command, otherwise it must wait at least10 msec before sending another command. When the master does not receive a response from the slavewithin the 10 msec timeout, it may assume that communications have ceased and take appropriate measures.Cabling
The pin assignments for the 9-pin cable are as follows:Pin Master Slave 
1 Ground Ground 
2 Rcv A Xmit A 
3 Xmit B Rcv B 
4 Xmit Common Rcv Common 
5 Spare Spare 
6 Rcv Common Xmit Common

Enable operation of slave device from local panel according to the local enable map set by the "4X B8"Local Key Map command.10 01 ACK
Slave Sends this when it receives a command from Master.11 12 NAK
When a communication error is detected, the slave sends this command with a "1" in the followingposition indicating the appropriate error condition:7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 
TimeOut FramingError OverrunError ParityError X ChecksumError X Undefinedcommand 

20 00 Stop
Slave stops current motion.20 01 Play
Slave Starts to play from current location. When the "Sync play" mode is selected from the Systemmenu on the slave, "Play" has the same effect as 20.34 "Sync Play".20 02 Record
Slave begins recording. Exactly what happens depends on Auto Mode, record lockout, and edit presets.20 04 Standby Off
Turns off standby mode. For VTR, this causes the machine to unthread in stop. Affects EE/Tapeselection. Available only in Stop mode.20 05 Standby On
Turns on standby mode. For VTR, this causes the machine to stay threaded when in stop. AffectsEE/Tape selection.20 0F Eject
When this command is received, the slave will eject the tape.20.10 Fast Fwd
When this command is received, the slave device will run in fast forward mode. The speed depends onthe VTR; for the DVR2000 series it is 50 x play speed.2X.11 Jog Forward
2X.12 Var Forward
2X.13 Shuttle Forward
When these commands are received the slave device will move forward with the speed indicated byDATA-1 and DATA-2.When only DATA-1 is given, the speed wil be given by
                Tape Speed = 10^((N/32)-2) x play speed.
where N is the value of DATA-1. Some sample values are:Speed Speed Data 
0.1 32 (20H) 
1.0 64 (40H) 
2.9 79 (4FH) 
48.7 118 (76H) 

When a more precise speed value is required, then DATA-2 will be added. The speed formula for thiscase is
     Tape Speed = 10^((N/32)-2) + N'/256*(10^(((N+1)/32)-2)-10^((N/32)-2))
where N is the value of DATA-1 and N' is the value of DATA-2.
auth - in more standard terms, the formula says that DATA-2 is used to linealy interpolate between thevalue given by N and that of N+1.
The maximum jog speed is set in the System:System menu. The maximum Var speed is 3X play speed.The maximum shuttle speed is 50X play speed.
auth - There is considerable controversy over the minimum speed. For a speed value of 0, the aboveformula with only DATA-1 gives 10^-2, or .01 x play speed. The standard states that when a speedbetween 0 and the minumum is given, the slave moves at minimum speed. In fact, many editors andcontrol systems intend a "Shuttle 0" command ( 21 13 00 ) to pause the device and have it stop withoutdisengaging. Devices which fail to do so will creep about 1 frame/second in this situation.
20 20 Rewind
When it receives this command, the slave runs in reverse at maximum speed: on the DVR2000, this is50xplay speed.2X 21 Jog Rev
2X 22 Var Rev
2X 23 Shuttle Rev
When receiving one of the above commands, the slave will start running in accordance with the speeddata defined by DATA-1 and DATA-2. For the maximum and minimum speed see the 2X.12 ShuttleFwd command.20 30 Preroll
When this command is received the slave will search to the preroll position defined as the valueobtained by subtracting the preroll time set by the 44.31 Preroll Time Preset command from the INPOINT data stored in the IN ENTRY memory by the 40.10 In Entry command.24 31 Cue Up With Data
Cues the slave to the indicated time. Time is formatted as follows:        data-1      data-2      data-3     data-4      | Frame | | Seconds | | minutes | | hours |      | 10  1 | |   10 1  | |   10 1  | | 10 1  |
auth - this is how time is represented in all commands and responses using a time code. The numbersindicate that the 10s value is stored in the high nibble and the 1s value in the low nibble. This is not tobe confused with the 80-bit SMPTE timecode which is present in the analog timecode track on tape, orwith the VITC timecode.20 34 Sync Play
Prerolls the slave for the preset preroll time, then enters play mode.21 38 Prog Speed Play +
21 39 Prog Speed Play -
These commands play back the slave device in steps of 0.1% within the range of +/- 25.5% of playspeed. DATA-1 contains an 8-bit speed value. The deviation from nominal play speed is        Deviation(%)=0.1 x speed value
20 40 Preview
20 41 Review
20 42 Auto Edit
When one of these commands is received the slave goes into the indicated mode.This is all the spec states here. What actually happens is determined by the edit presets, in and outpoint selections, and ee/tape settings. Basically, all three set the device to the preroll position, and runat play speed up to the in point. In Preview, the slave switches to EE mode at the in point, and out atthe out point, simulating the edit without disturbing the recording media. In review, the slave simplycontinues to play at the in point and rolls to the outpoint. In Auto Edit, the channels indicated by theedit presets are put into record at the in point and the recoding proceeds to the out point.
20 43 Outpoint Preview
Sends transport to preset out point if insert mode is preset.2X 54 Anti-Clog Timer Disable
Disables the anti-clog timer. This timer is responsible for unthreading the tape upon timeout to savewear on the heads. If a system disables this timer, it should take responsibility for head wear avoidanceitself.2X 55 Anti-Clog Timer Enable
Enables anti-clog timer.20 60 Full EE Off
Clears all channels from EE mode regardless of EDIT PRESET channels assigned by the 41.30 EDITPRESET command. It takes the slave 5 frames to perform this operation after it receieves thecommand.20 61 Full EE On
Sets all channels to EE mode regardless of EDIT PRESET channels assigned by the 41.30 EDITPRESET command. It takes the slave 5 frames to perform this operation after it receieves thecommand.20 63 Select EE On
This command sets only the preset channels assigned by the 41.30 Edit Preset command to EE mode.The EE mode is cleared by the 20.64 Edit Off command. It takes the slave 5 frames to perform thisoperation after receiving the command.20 64 Edit Off
This command will stop recording without affecting the state of motion of the device. Any channels inrecord will come out in response to this command, after 5 frames of delay. This command also clearsthe Manual Edit Record mode and the Select EE mode.20 65 Edit On
This command is used to actually initiate recording. When the device is playing, and the edit presetsset by the 4X 30 Edit Preset command are in place, the preset channels will enter record a fixed delayafter this command is received. The slave will enter Edit Rec mode at this point. It takes the slave 5frames to enter Edit Rec after receiving this command.20 6A Freeze Off
This command un-freezes the output of the device.20 6A Freeze On
This command freezes the output of the device. There is usually a 2-5 frame delay associcated with theactual freeze.44 00 Timer-1 Preset

The level data are interpreted as per the formula:Input Level = 20 log [(Level Data)/(4000h)] (dB)
Which gives coverage over the range of +12dB to -infinity.4X A1 Audio Output Level
Controls the audio output level. When the 41 A1 command is received, the audio output level of thechannels selected in DATA-1 will be set to the reference level. Otherwise, it operates as per the 4X.A0Audio input level command.4X A2 Audio Adv Level
Controls the audio advance level. When the 41 A2 fixed doc error here command is received, the audioadvance level of the channels selectd by DATA-1 will be set to the reference level. Otherwise, itoperates as per the 4X.A0 Audio input level command.4X A8 Audio Output Phase
Sets the autdio output phase. The 42.A8 command determines the audio output phase according to the16-bit value encoded with the low byte in DATA-1 and the high byte in DATA-2. The values areinterpreted as 2s complement binary, and currently have a range of +/- 80 samples. When the 40.A8command is received, the slave will set the audio ouput phase to its nominal value.4X A9 Audio Adv Out Phase
Sets the Advance audio output phase. The 42.A9 command determines the audio advance phaseaccording to the 16-bit value encoded with the low byte in DATA-1 and the high byte in DATA-2. Thevalues are interpreted as 2s complement binary, and currently have a range of +0/-50 samples. the40.A9 will set the audio advance phase to its nominal value.4X AA Cross Fade Time Preset
4X B8 Local Key Map
When the slave receives the 00.1D Local Enable command, the control panel may be used according tothe local key map that was set by this command. When the slave receives the 00.0C Local Disablecommand all the keys, buttons, and adjustment controls on the control panel are disabled. The Ejectbutton can always be used. If the slave receives the 41.B8 command, the local key map is preset by theblock level in accordance with DATA-1. IF it receives the 4X.B8 command ( X > 2 ) The local keymap is preset by the Switch level.Block Level switches:
        Bit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5   Bit 4   Bit 3   Bit 2   Bit 1   Bit 0                          Tracking Monitor  Audio   Video Transport                          Control  Control Control Control Control"1": This function will be enabled when in remote"0": This function will be disabled in remote.
When DATA-2 or more are added, control data with two bytes per each block assigned by DATA-1 areadded following DATA-1.
At present the transport switches are defined as follows:
Bit 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 
1st Byte Execute Preroll Search  Rec Play Stop Standby 
2nd Byte      Var Jog Shuttle 

None of the other blocks have any switches assigned, but rather operate as follows:
Video Control: Video phase and Sync phase can be adjusted on the system menu in remote mode.
Audio Control: Audio levels and output phase can be adjusted on the Audio:DA out menu in remotemode.
Monitor Control: the wfm monitor output selection on the system:wfm monitor menu and the montiorlevel adjustments and monitor out selection on the system:audio monitor menu can be adjusted inremote mode.
Tracking Control: Tracking adjustments in the system:tracking menu can be made in remote mode.

Requests the TIME DATA or USER BITS. Slave responds as per DATA-1:      Bit 7   Bit 6   Bit 5   Bit 4   Bit 3   Bit 2   Bit 1   Bit 0                       VITC    LTC   TIMER 2 TIMER 1   VITC   LTC                         UB      UB                     TIME   TIME
That is to say that the response follows the bit set in DATA-1 as per the following tableReqest Response 
DATA-1=01 LTC TIME 74.04: LTC TIME DATA 
 74.14: CORRECTED LTC TIME DATA 
DATA-1=02 VITC TIME 74.06: VITC TIME DATA

 74.15: HOLD UB (LTC) DATA 
DATA-1=20 VITC UB 74.07: UB (VITC) DATA 
 74.17: HOLD UB (VITC) DATA 

Now, when requesting timecode, the results depend on the tape speed because at very low speeds ( lessthan .25 play speed ) it may not be possible to recover timecode. However, if VITC is present, that maybe used instead. To automate this decision process, Sony has provided the special 61.0C.03 commandwhich will return the best source of time code as per the table below. Note that when both LTC andVITC are not good you get back the 74.14 corrected LTC data. In this case, the time is actually the lastgood LTC time corrected by the tape timer.Tape speed > .25LTC Status VITC Status Return Data Return code

Description of Bits:
Data 0:Bit 5: Tape Unthreaded (Cassette Out) When the tape is threaded, this is 0. When it iscompletely unthreaded this is 1. When threading or unthreading, who knows what it is.
Bit 4: Servo Ref Missing When servo reference is absent this is 1.
Bit 0: Local When remote operation is inhibited by the "remote/local" switch on the panelthis is 1.

Data 1:Bit 7: Standby When the tape is threaded and the scanner is locked but the tape is stopped,this is 1.
Bit 5: Stop When the machine is in full stop, this is 1. The thread state depends on thetape/ee and standby settings.
Bit 4: Eject When the tape is ejecting this is 1.
Bit 3: Rewind When the machine is in fast reverse this is 1.
Bit 2: Fast Fwd When the machine is in fast forward this is 1.
Bit 1: Record This bit goes from 0 to 1 some number of frames after the machine startsrecording. For the DVR2000 we measured 5 frames. Others have varying delays on therecord status.
Bit 0: Play This bit goes from 0 to 1 some number of frames after the machine startsplaying. For the DVR2000 we measured 5 frames. Others have varying delays on the playstatus.

Data 2:Bit 7: Servo Lock 1 indicates servos are locked. This is a necessary condition for an edit tooccur correctly.
Bit 6: TSO Mode Bit is 1 in tape speed override: in this mode, audio and video are stilllocked though speed is off play speed by +/- up to 15%.

The Status bits communicate much about the progress of a motion command. The precise timing of eachsignal varies almost from machine to machine, and many edit controlers expect certain timing behaviour ofthese signals. Herein lie many of the problems associated with edit controllers, edit timing, and just plainwacky transport behavior.
